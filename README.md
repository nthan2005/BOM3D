# MEMORA
MEMORA: A 3D multiplayer web game built with React, Three.js, Node.js, and Socket.IO. Players control robot animal avatars in a 3D dimension, collecting memory shards to escape. This is a portfolio project (MVP) showcasing web development, 3D rendering, and real-time multiplayer, deployed on AWS (Ubuntu).


## Week 1 Progress (May 27 â€“ June 2, 2025)
- Initialized GitHub repo with basic structure.
- Set up Ubuntu dev environment (VS Code, Node.js, Python).
- Created a Three.js 3D cube demo (run locally).
